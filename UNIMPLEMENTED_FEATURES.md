## Unimplemented Features
I Wasnt able to implement the following features due to time constraints, 
, or because they were out of scope for the project:

- [ ] Video Uploading
- [ ] Advanced Recommendation Algorithm
- [ ] Video Transcribing
- [ ] Video Thumbnail Generation
- [ ] AI-Powered Content Moderation
- [ ] AI-Companion

## Video Uploading
I wasn't able to implement video uploading to cloudflare, because if you want to use it you need to enter your credit card details, and I didn't want to do that.
For profile images and thumbnails I used Cloudinary, which has a free tier that allows you to upload images without entering your credit card details. However, for video uploading, I would have needed to use Cloudflare R2, because Cloudinary 
has not a lot of free storage. 

## Advanced Recommendation Algorithm
I wasn't able to implement an advanced recommendation algorithm, because it would have required a lot of time and resources to implement.
I technically have all the code to do it already, since I implemented a working tag-based recommendation algorithm for the firebase backend, 
but since I switched to supabase, I didn't have time to implement it again for the new backend. 

## Video Transcribing
For usable video transcribing I would have needed to use a third-party service like OpenAI's Whisper API, which is not free and would have required a lot of time to implement.
I implemented a basic video transcribing feature that uses local whisper, but that would require the user to wait a long time, since it would need to download the ~2GB model and then transcribe the video, which is not a good user experience.
In my testing the transcription process took around 5 minutes for a 1-minute video, which is not acceptable for a production application.

## Video Thumbnail Generation
Video Thumbnail Generation requires processing the video to extract a frame and then upload it as an image. 
Cloudinary provides a way to generate thumbnails from videos, but there are heavy rate limits on the free tier.
And as stated above, I wasn't able to use Cloudflare R2 for video uploading, so I couldn't use their thumbnail generation feature either.

## AI-Powered Content Moderation
AI-Powered Content Moderation would require integrating an AI service that can analyze the content of videos and comments to detect non-relevant content.
AI services are often not free, and even if they were, it would have heavy rate limits that would make it difficult to implement.
Since there isn't even a way of uploading videos, there is no point in implementing content moderation, since there would be no content to moderate.

## AI-Companion
As stated above, AI services are pretty expensive, so i decided to skip this feature for now.
